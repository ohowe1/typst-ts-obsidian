# Typst.ts Obsidian

Typst rendering support for Obsidian using [Typst.ts](https://github.com/Myriad-Dreamin/typst.ts). The patching logic of the math widget is adapted from [obsidian-math-in-callout](https://github.com/RyotaUshio/obsidian-math-in-callout).

To use it, simply write Typst math inside `$...$` for inline math or `$$...$$` for block math in your Obsidian notes.

Please report any bugs on the [GitHub Issues page](https://github.com/ohowe1/typst-ts-obsidian/issues).
